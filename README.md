# Region Attacher
Allows attaching Scene Regions to templates on template creation.

Currently just adds a checkbox on the item page of any item which has a template-placing effect, and if checked will create a scene region with the exact shape of the border of the template.

### Plans for release 1.0.0:
- Allow pre-configuration of scene region behaviors from the item sheet, so that the region created will already be set up
- Add setting for default created scene region visibility (or include in above, depending on how pre-configuration window is set up)

### Potential plans for beyond:
- Have scene regions reference highlighted grid rather than template outline for perfect grid-based parity of area coverage
- Allow option for scene regions to be created _instead of_ templates
